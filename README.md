## How To Use
In the game there are 2 different special attacks, a ranged projectile attack which allows for distance attacking, and a close range melee attack; balancing for these attacks has been made to prevent spamming. The aim of the game is to push your opponent off the stage using these attacks, each time a player goes offstage they lose a life, once a player has lost all lives, the game ends and the player left standing wins. Both the damage and lives remaining for each player is displayed at the bottom of the screen, the higher damage a player has, the further they will be pushed back when they are hit making it harder to stay on the stage.

The game also contains powerups which are located in various points in each stage and all 3 items have different uses. The power weight item increases the amount of damage you deal with both attacks, the heart container reduces your damage, and the potion grants an additional life.
