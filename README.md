## How To Use
In the game there are 5 different attacks that are all used in different circumstances and all deal different amounts of damage. The Special attack and Ranged attack deal the most damage but are slower to pull off while faster attacks like the Basic and Air attacks deal less damage. The aim of the game is to push your opponent off of the stage and eliminate their 3 lives to win the match. Dealing damage to the enemy; which is shown next to the players name on the screen, allows for you to hit your opponent further distances making it harder to stay on the stage the more damage you receive.

Powerups and obstacles are also scattered throughout the stages and have various effects on players. There are spike traps which take away one of your lives if you touch them, powerup weights which increase the amount of damage you deal, heart containers which give you additional lives and health potions which decrease your damage percentage.
